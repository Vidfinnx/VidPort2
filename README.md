**THIS IS UPDATE #3 TO MY ORIGINAL PORTFOLIO**

**Added More Projects Trip Scavenger App and Tech Blog**

This took a ton of time and is a continuous work in progress! (Challenging)

My original site was super complex and not mobile responsive at all,

I have put in many many hours into this and will continue to do so!

It should be mobile response and is very basic with some of the links

to be updated in the future and made more fancy :)

Refactored Code needs cleanup badly to erase the mistakes of the past

and clean up unused code, I ran out of time for the cleanup.

Github, Linked In Profiles and Resume all are placeholders and works in progress

This project is 100% original and I set off to challenge myself from the start

by incorporating things I had no idea how they work but I thought they looked neat (See Spinning Planet Links)

***Refactored in 3840x2160 (4K)***

***Tested at multiple resolutions + Using DevTools Simulated Mobile Devices Iphone and Ipads in horizontal and vertical alignments***
